# Game Tutorial: Dodge the Creeps w/ Modifications

# Description of modifcations:
The basic mechanic/theme of the game is to avoid touching the 'creeps' as they will eliminate you and end the game. I added three lives to the player to make it easier for them to live longer and also added a Best score label which will track the highest score reached in that game session. Furthermore, made the background color to violet and for the controls used 'WASD' for moving instead of the arrow keys. For starting the game, the sapce bar is used instead of the enter button. These game features make the game more interesting as they add more value to the game.
